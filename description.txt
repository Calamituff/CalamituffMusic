WATCH OUT PROFANITY

It's the sequel to Calamituff's Terraria Sound Replacement! Now replacing Calamity Mod's soundtrack with new, 'superior' tracks! (it's recommended that you don't have Calamity Music Mod enabled)

This mod replaces all Calamity boss themes and some vanilla ones!

As of now, Acid Rain themes won't play, but that should be sorted in the future.
